The Jupyter Notebook file in this repository contains a project that extracts stock and revenue data using yfinance and BeautifulSoup, and visualizes it using Plotly.

Please note that GitHub does not natively support interactive Plotly graphs. Therefore, static screenshots of the graphs have been added to the root directory of the repository.
